            <p>I don't know how I ended up there, I don't remember why I was there, I didn't remember who I was, my past erased, and my present non-existent. I only knew that the angels were walking me through my life, showing me what was and what could have been, judging me. Was I going to hell for my sins, or to heaven for my virtues? Time was slipping, morning and evening were the same, day and night had no difference. Every memory melted together, my past and future the same. My soul had no body, I was nothing, I was just air. Every talking thing was a threat, no matter how much i knew the person, no matter how much i cared for them, they wanted me dead, they were after me, they were plotting against me. Everything had a connection, everything was foreshadowing. Surroundings changed with words, and reality was bending against my will. I was a rat in a maze, every wall that I knocked down was just a wall that I'd replace, I was stuck in the same scenes over and over and over again, and I seemingly would never get out. Something was talking to me, I don't know who, or where, or why, but they were whispering. Everything felt like a cruel joke, a mockery of what my life had been reduced to. Every face I knew became stranger, I saw beneath their faces and emotions, I saw their intentions, I could smell it. Fear, lust, worry and excitement was all that I could smell in the crowd, it was all that they felt. I didn’t know what I felt, because I was everything and nothing at the same time, I had reached some kind of cosmic level of being. And yet I tried my best to conceal my own reality and being slipping away. The shadows followed me, mocked me as I tried to walk home in the freezing weather, every corner, every bush had its own shadow staring at me, even my own shadow was threatening, but I kept walking, I kept walking, I kept walking. And even in my own bed I felt unsafe, for dream and reality were really not so different in the moment, every dream I had could just as much be reality, and I would never really know. None of this was ever real, yet it was real in every single sense of the word. I had my wallpapers peeled, I was judged by the divine, I was a constant, I was everything and nothing, I was and was not, I was thrown through a thousand realities in the span of a second, each of them as terrible as the last, and none of them better. Every person just another version of me, I was staring into a broken mirror, watching hundreds of shattered pieces of me. I saw the roots of evil, I saw the birth of good, I saw how there was no difference, only survival. I saw every core of every person. I saw time itself; it is thought that time is linear and never ending, yet I saw it shift and flow, back and forth, up and down, round and round, it went where it wanted to, and it had no mercy, not even for me, who had broken the boundaries of reality.</p>

            <p>I don’t know what happened, what led to this event, why it happened. I was different, everything was different, things were not right, yet as right as they could be. It was a new era, a new beginning, a new me, and I was unstoppable, I could do anything, there were no borders, no restrictions, I was free from the bounds of law and ethics. I could physically feel the freedom I had achieved through nothing but my mind. I could physically grasp this satisfaction and happiness I felt, my chest was no longer heavy, no longer burdened by my past or present, my legs no longer struggling to walk and my head no longer stuck in a headlock. I was the ideal, I was the dream. My mind was working faster than ever, a thousands of ideas, a millions of thoughts all overlapping each other, and i wanted to share my head more than anything ever, so i talked and talked and talked in chains that never truly stopped, but no matter how i moved, how i spoke, how i acted, everyone was stuck in the past, everyone was slower, more grey, i was stuck in a memory where i'm the only one conscious. The mirror cheered me more than anything ever, I saw a goddess looking back at me, I saw the ideal person, an unstoppable beautiful force, that was what the mirror told me. Angels had resurrected me, given me another chance to fix my condemned life, another chance at living my life, and I used that opportunity and I went out, I created, I spoke and I moved like never before, reborn from the ashes of my past. I saw all as was, time, matter and all that is us, I could understand it, I could see it, and the sun stood tall behind me, but not taller than me, the sun was on my side, supporting my every step no matter how vile or unethical. Everyone around me went from dear friends to enemies, they were after me, jealous of my new life, out to get me, but no one could stop the ever flowing power that I had, that I was. I was going to escape, leave behind my origins, finally leave behind my past, start all over, create a life that I always yearned for. But i was foolish, blinded by power and ego, and unable to see that i was already stopped before i knew it, and not long after i found myself twitching and trembling out of sheer never stopping energy flowing through every artery and vein, sitting in a locked room, with a guard, waiting for my assessment. They saw me as a sick person, someone insane and gone, they questioned me and observed me as nothing but an animal. I understood everything but why they didn't see me as a superior being. I felt unresistable rage, I walked with pure pride and determination the next day, everyone I held close became sworn enemies, and I knew that day that I was alone, but in a way that was so beautifully empowering. People stared at me with something I couldn't quite grasp, caution maybe, something that distanced themselves from me, but I couldn't care less I was far better than them. I knew there and then, that day, i had to take matters in my own hands, the angels had given me a second chance, and I would use it to cleanse the world, take the lives that had condemned me the first time, and bring justice to myself, i wanted to show those vile people what they did to me. But before i could, something changed, i felt life speeding away from me, bugs, grass and air was screaming into my ears, as i felt my freedom, my satisfaction slip away from me just as sand seeping away through my fingers. I felt my power fade and my ego shatter, my walls were building up again and I was bound once again to laws and ethics that I at heart did not believe. It was all just a preview of what could be, a delusion, a mockery.

            <p>I'm a revenant, resurrected from the dead, given a second chance by the angels to atone for my sins. I don’t remember how I died, but I died disappointed in the life I lead. I saw angels disguised as those who were dear to me, they guided me through the life that I had, they judged me, they were disappointed too. All my life I had turned my back away from the divine, angered that they abandoned me, left me in the pit of fire where I in the end perished in holy fire. They guided me through that miserable life, saw my regret for all that I saw and fought through and they showed me a sliver of pity. But there was an expensive price of being resurrected. We agreed on a compromise, if they bring me back to life thus giving me the label of a revenant, I must fight side by side with the angels, they let me keep my sinful character, and they supply me with power so divine which also came with a price. But what would I not give to redo what I did wrong. I rose from the dead with surging power, unhuman tendencies, no need for rest, no need for human simplicities, I was given this as a head start, got me hooked on that holy surge. Others looked at me as a mad person, they didn’t understand what I was given. I went beyond human morals and ethics, nothing stood in my way, I was simply absolute. The power comes from within but only such as angels can bring it forth, meaning that at some point the power exhausts, and the angels once again fall back. I'm left in agony, a low lower than hell, exhausted from days of not resting, exhausted from all the power that once ran through my veins, in withdrawal from the highs, begging the angels to bring it forth. But the price of being resurrected, came with control, when angels didn't see fit, they’d leave you in agony, when they did see fit, they’d bring it forth. Call you to a limbo to warn you what is coming, warn you of the atrocities about to happen. My life did not change after becoming a revenant, my life didn’t turn divine and saintful as i promised, i live again but with more misery than ever, never quite knowing when the angels come forth, never really knowing when my next supply of relief comes, i live in constant agony, stuck in the pit of fire as once before, but used by angels to fight their battles once in a while, getting a glimpse of heaven, getting a glimpse of the power they possess, and what i truly am capable of.</p>
