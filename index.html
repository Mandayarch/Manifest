  <p>I don't know how I ended up there, I don't remember why I was there, I didn't remember who I was, my past erased, and my present non-existent. I only knew that the angels were walking me through my life, showing me what was and what could have been, judging me. Was I going to hell for my sins, or to heaven for my virtues? Time was slipping, morning and evening were the same, day and night had no difference. Every memory melted together, my past and future the same. My soul had no body, I was nothing, I was just air. Every talking thing was a threat, no matter how much i knew the person, no matter how much i cared for them, they wanted me dead, they were after me, they were plotting against me. Everything had a connection, everything was foreshadowing. Surroundings changed with words, and reality was bending against my will. I was a rat in a maze, every wall that I knocked down was just a wall that I'd replace, I was stuck in the same scenes over and over and over again, and I seemingly would never get out. Something was talking to me, I don't know who, or where, or why, but they were whispering. Everything felt like a cruel joke, a mockery of what my life had been reduced to. Every face I knew became stranger, I saw beneath their faces and emotions, I saw their intentions, I could smell it. Fear, lust, worry and excitement was all that I could smell in the crowd, it was all that they felt. I didn’t know what I felt, because I was everything and nothing at the same time, I had reached some kind of cosmic level of being. And yet I tried my best to conceal my own reality and being slipping away. The shadows followed me, mocked me as I tried to walk home in the freezing weather, every corner, every bush had its own shadow staring at me, even my own shadow was threatening, but I kept walking, I kept walking, I kept walking. And even in my own bed I felt unsafe, for dream and reality were really not so different in the moment, every dream I had could just as much be reality, and I would never really know. None of this was ever real, yet it was real in every single sense of the word. I had my wallpapers peeled, I was judged by the divine, I was a constant, I was everything and nothing, I was and was not, I was thrown through a thousand realities in the span of a second, each of them as terrible as the last, and none of them better. Every person just another version of me, I was staring into a broken mirror, watching hundreds of shattered pieces of me. I saw the roots of evil, I saw the birth of good, I saw how there was no difference, only survival. I saw every core of every person. I saw time itself; it is thought that time is linear and never ending, yet I saw it shift and flow, back and forth, up and down, round and round, it went where it wanted to, and it had no mercy, not even for me, who had broken the boundaries of reality.</p>
